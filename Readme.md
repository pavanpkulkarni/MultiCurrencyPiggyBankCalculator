# Multi Currency PiggyBank Calculator

This project is was a fun wya to explore and learn Streamlit.

The inspiration for this is from and for my toddler. A few days ago when I opened her piggy bank, I realized that the piggy bank has a tonnes of coind from different countries. 
It was not only hard to calculate the total $$$ but also hard enough to keep a track of switching between currencies and their respective xchange rates. 

Hence Streamlit to the rescue ðŸŽ¯

## TODO:

1. I need to work on refactoring the code to make it look neat
2. Add error handling
3. Add unit tests for currency conversions and calculations
